# Separation of Concerns

## UI Components (Presentation Layer):

Display data received via props.
Handle user interactions (events).
Call handler functions from hooks.
No business logic, calculations, or validations.
Pure presentation components.

## Business Logic Layer:

Hooks: State management and operations.
Utilities: Pure functions for validation, calculations, conversions, .etc.
All business rules, validations, and calculations live here.
Components delegate all logic to this layer.
